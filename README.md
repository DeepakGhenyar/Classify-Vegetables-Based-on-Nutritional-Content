# 🥕 Vegetable Classification using Nutritional Content

This project is part of the AI MSE (Mid-Semester Exam) and involves building a machine learning model to classify vegetables into categories like root, leafy, and fruit based on their nutritional values.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To classify vegetables using nutritional features such as Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Fiber into categories like **root**, **leafy**, and **fruit** using a supervised machine learning approach.

---

## 💡 Introduction

Understanding the nutritional classification of vegetables is crucial for health, diet planning, and agriculture. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to automate this classification process using a dataset of vegetable nutritional contents.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Encoded categorical labels.
  - Standardized numerical features.
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
  - Confusion Matrix (visualized as heatmap).
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🧪 Results

The model was able to classify the vegetables with good accuracy using just three features. A confusion matrix and classification report were used to validate the model performance.
